The aim of this project is to create a distance-based control system using an ultrasonic sensor and an Arduino board. 
The system will turn on a relay when an object is detected within a certain distance from the sensor, 
as indicated by the measured distance being less than the specified threshold. 
This type of system can be used for applications such as automated door opening systems, proximity-based triggering of devices, or obstacle detection in robotics.

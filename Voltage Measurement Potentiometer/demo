This project aims to create a simple voltage measurement system using an Arduino and an LCD display.
This project provides a basic example of how to interface an analog sensor with an Arduino and display the measured voltage on an LCD screen.
This project also includes interfacing an LED to control its brightness. 
This adds a visual element to the project, allowing users to see the brightness change corresponding to the measured voltage.
